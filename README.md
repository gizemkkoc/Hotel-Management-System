In my Hotel Management System project, I kept the data in a SQL database containing the hotel reservation system, 
then I designed a website for this hotel and connected this database and the website.

Database Management System: Microsoft SQL Server 2019 
Development Environment: Visual Studio 2022
Backend Programming Language:C# (C-Sharp) 
Web Framework (Optional, for User Interface): .NETCORE
